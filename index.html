			<p class="TNR">My name is Tiana Behtash and I am a senior at UW-Madison studying Industrial Engineering. I’m originally from the Bay Area, California and chose to attend my dad’s alma mater here in Wisconsin to experience a different part of the United States. As an engineer I hope to work in one of the aerospace, defense, aviation, and automotive industries. Throughout the course of my life, there have been numerous artistic and literary influences that have shaped my current interests and worldview. This website displays some of the books, movies, and music that changed my life and made me the person I am today. </p>
