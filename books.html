I read this my senior year of high school and have since re-read it numerous times. Orwell's depiction of a totalitarian and repressive government is shockingly accurate and relevant today.</p>

Although I find Shakespearean literature difficult to understand, the story of Hamlet is one of the most amazing things I have ever read. It tells the story of betrayal and revenge.</p>
